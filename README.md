# covid19model

Nearly every line of code in this repo comes from the covid19model repo put together at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Imperial College London, and hosted at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model). I hope they don't mind that I'm putting this on my personal GitHub. I'm only doing this because I'm adapting the model for the U.S. and don't want to lose my own work. All credit should be directed towards the folks at the MRC and their work, and I'm grateful they made this code available.
